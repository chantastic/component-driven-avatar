# Component-driven Avatar

Hey, I'm [chan](https://chan.dev/twitter) ðŸ‘‹

This repo is setup for a stream with [Nick Taylor](https://twitter.com/nickytonline), on 2022-09-06, at https://www.twitch.tv/nickytonline/.

The goal of this stream is to build up a basic avatar component (using CSS and React) in Storybook and Chromatic.

This doc provides a decent amount of guidance for every step of the process.

## `npx storybook repro`

`npx storybook repro` is designed for setting up reproductions.

I like it because it's a great way to start a single component with Storybook.

The CLI will ask you which `view-layer` and `builder` you'd like to use.

*For this example, select `React` and `webpack`*
